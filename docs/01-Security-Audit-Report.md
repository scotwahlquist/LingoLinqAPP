# LingoLinq-AAC Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

LingoLinq-AAC is a Ruby on Rails 6.1 application serving as an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) platform. The codebase demonstrates strong security fundamentals with comprehensive authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms. While the application shows good defensive security practices, there are several areas for improvement to align with modern security standards.

## Technology Stack Analysis

- **Framework**: Ruby on Rails 6.1 with Ruby 3.2.8
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with potential sharding support
- **Frontend**: Ember.js application within Rails asset pipeline
- **Authentication**: Custom token-based system with 2FA support
- **Deployment**: Heroku-configured with Puma web server
- **Monitoring**: New Relic, Bugsnag error tracking
- **Security**: Rack::Attack rate limiting, SSL enforcement

## Security Assessment

### Strengths ‚úÖ

1. **Strong Authentication System**
   - Custom secure password hashing using GoSecure library
   - Two-factor authentication (2FA) with TOTP implementation
   - Valet password system for supervised access
   - Password reset with proper token expiration

2. **Authorization & Permissions**
   - Comprehensive permission system with role-based access control
   - Organization-based user management
   - Proper scope validation for API access
   - Masquerading capabilities with proper validation

3. **Security Headers & Configuration**
   - SSL enforcement in production (`config.force_ssl = true`)
   - X-Frame-Options handling for embedding
   - Parameter filtering for sensitive data
   - CORS configuration for API endpoints

4. **Rate Limiting & Throttling**
   - Rack::Attack implementation with Redis backing
   - Different limits for protected endpoints
   - IP-based throttling with configurable thresholds

5. **Data Protection**
   - Secure serialization for sensitive settings
   - Paper Trail auditing for key model changes
   - Proper database connection handling
   - Environment-based configuration management

### Security Concerns ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Rails Version** - Running Rails 6.1 (TODO comment mentions upgrading to 7.2)
2. **Content Security Policy** - No comprehensive CSP implementation
3. **Session Management** - Custom token system may need security review
4. **File Upload Security** - Limited validation visible for uploaded content
5. **Database Queries** - Some use of `connection.execute` with SQL strings

### Vulnerabilities Found üîç

**Medium Risk:**
- Custom authentication system bypasses Rails' built-in security features
- Limited input validation patterns observed
- Potential for privilege escalation through organization management

**Low Risk:**
- TODO comments indicate incomplete features
- Missing Content-Security-Policy headers
- X-Frame-Options selectively disabled in some controllers

## Code Quality Assessment

### Positive Aspects
- Well-organized MVC structure with concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage (RSpec)
- Proper use of Rails conventions
- Good separation of concerns

### Areas for Improvement
- Multiple TODO comments indicating technical debt
- Complex permission system could benefit from simplification
- Large controller methods in some areas
- Mixed authentication patterns

## Recommendations

### High Priority üö®

1. **Framework Upgrade**
   - Upgrade Rails to 7.2 as noted in TODO comments
   - Update Ruby version to latest stable
   - Review and update all gem dependencies

2. **Security Headers Enhancement**
   ```ruby
   # Add comprehensive CSP
   config.force_ssl = true
   config.ssl_options = { 
     secure_cookies: true,
     hsts: { expires: 1.year, subdomains: true }
   }
   ```

3. **Authentication Security Review**
   - Audit custom GoSecure library implementation
   - Implement session timeout mechanisms
   - Add device fingerprinting for enhanced security

### Medium Priority ‚ö°

4. **Input Validation Hardening**
   - Implement strong parameter validation
   - Add file upload security scanning
   - Enhance sanitization for user-generated content

5. **Database Security**
   - Review all `connection.execute` usage
   - Implement prepared statements where possible
   - Add database connection encryption

6. **API Security**
   - Implement API versioning strategy
   - Add request/response validation
   - Enhanced rate limiting per user/organization

### Low Priority üìã

7. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Address TODO comments systematically
   - Refactor complex permission logic
   - Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD

8. **Monitoring Enhancement**
   - Add security event logging
   - Implement anomaly detection
   - Enhanced error tracking with security context

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Rails upgrade and dependency updates
- **Week 3-4**: Security headers and CSP implementation  
- **Week 5-6**: Authentication system audit and improvements
- **Week 7-8**: Input validation and API security enhancements

## Conclusion

LingoLinq-AAC demonstrates solid security fundamentals with a mature authentication system and proper access controls. The main risks stem from using an older Rails version and the complexity of the custom authentication system. Prioritizing the Rails upgrade and security header implementation will significantly improve the security posture.

The codebase shows no evidence of malicious intent and follows established security practices for a Rails application of this scale and complexity.
