    *   **Frequency Analysis:** Track the most frequently used words, phrases, and buttons.
    *   **Path Analysis:** Analyze common navigation paths between boards and button sequences.
    *   **Heatmaps:** Visualize button usage on communication boards to identify popular and underutilized areas.
    *   **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggest board layout optimizations or new vocabulary based on individual usage data.
*   **Deliverables:** Analytics dashboard (internal for administrators/therapists), data collection and processing pipeline for usage data.
*   **Success Metrics:** Data-driven improvements to communication board design, increased efficiency of communication, identification of common communication goals.

## 2. Modern UI/UX Strategy

**Goal:** Transform the LingoLinq-AAC interface into a modern, intuitive, and highly accessible experience for all users.
