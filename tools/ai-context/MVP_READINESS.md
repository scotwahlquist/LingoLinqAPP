## Conclusion

LingoLinq-AAC has strong foundational AAC functionality but requires significant security and compliance work before school district deployment. The application cannot be safely deployed in educational environments without addressing the critical security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps identified.

**Key Recommendations:**
1. **Do not deploy to schools** until all Critical and High priority security issues are resolved
2. **Prioritize compliance features** - COPPA and FERPA compliance are legal requirements, not optional features  
3. **Focus on AAC-specific needs** - Remember that users depend on this for essential communication
4. **Plan for iterative deployment** - Start with pilot schools, expand gradually
5. **Invest in long-term modernization** - Current technical debt will become more expensive to fix over time

**Success depends on:** Executive commitment to security-first approach, adequate budget for comprehensive fixes, and maintaining focus on the critical communication needs of AAC users throughout the modernization process.
