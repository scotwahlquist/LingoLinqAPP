## Project Background & Goals
- **Origin**: Fork of SweetSuite AAC (which forked CoughDrop AAC)
- **Rebrand**: Converting from SweetSuite to LingoLinq
- **Major Modernization**: Updating outdated tech stack, security, UX/UI
- **Tech Migration**: Replace Ember frontend, potentially Rails backend over time
- **AI Integration**: Adding LLMs and ML capabilities
- **Team Structure**: Small 3rd party dev team + AI dev agents for different roles

## Current Tech Debt
- Outdated dependencies and security vulnerabilities
- Legacy Ember.js frontend (needs replacement)
- Aging Rails backend (evaluate for modernization)
- UI/UX needs complete refresh

## Development Strategy
- Gradual tech stack modernization
- AI agent integration for specialized roles (backend, frontend, design, AI/ML)
- Team coordination through shared context and documentation
