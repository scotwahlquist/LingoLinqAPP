# LingoLinq-AAC Compliance Requirements

Meeting compliance standards is critical for LingoLinq-AAC, especially given its target audience of children and educational institutions. This document outlines the key requirements for COPPA, FERPA, and WCAG 2.1 AA.

## 1. COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)

**Purpose:** Protects the online privacy of children under 13 years of age.

### Key Requirements & Deliverables:
*   **Parental Consent:** Implement robust mechanisms for verifiable parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13. This includes clear disclosures about data practices.
*   **Data Collection Limitation:** Minimize the collection of personal information from children to only what is strictly necessary for the service.
*   **Secure Data Storage:** Ensure all collected child data is stored securely with appropriate encryption and access controls.
*   **Data Retention Policy:** Establish and adhere to a clear data retention policy, deleting child data when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.
*   **Parental Access & Control:** Provide parents with the ability to review, delete, or prevent further collection/use of their child's personal information.
*   **Clear Privacy Policy:** Develop an easily understandable and prominent privacy policy that details data collection, use, and disclosure practices for children's information.
*   **Third-Party Disclosure:** Clearly disclose any third parties with whom children's data is shared and ensure those third parties also comply with COPPA.

### Success Metrics:
*   Legal review confirms COPPA compliance for all data handling processes.
*   No COPPA-related complaints or violations.
*   Clear, accessible, and legally compliant parental consent flows.

## 2. FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)

**Purpose:** Protects the privacy of student education records.

### Key Requirements & Deliverables:
*   **Student Education Records Protection:** Implement strict controls over access to and disclosure of student education records (e.g., usage logs, progress data, communication content).
*   **Access Controls:** Ensure only authorized school officials, parents, or eligible students have access to education records, based on defined roles and permissions.
*   **Data Sharing Restrictions:** Prohibit unauthorized sharing of student data with third parties. Any sharing must be for legitimate educational purposes and with appropriate agreements in place.
*   **Data Security:** Maintain robust security measures to protect student data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
*   **Audit Trails:** Implement comprehensive logging and audit trails for all access to and modifications of student education records.
*   **Parent/Student Rights:** Support the rights of parents and eligible students to inspect and review education records, request amendments, and control disclosure of personally identifiable information.

### Success Metrics:
*   Legal review confirms FERPA compliance for all student data handling.
*   Robust role-based access control (RBAC) implemented for student data.
*   Comprehensive audit logs for all data access and modifications.
*   No FERPA-related complaints or violations.

## 3. WCAG 2.1 AA (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 Level AA)

**Purpose:** Provides a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities, including those using AAC.

### Key Principles & Deliverables:

#### Perceivable:
*   **Text Alternatives (1.1.1):** Provide text alternatives for all non-text content (e.g., images, audio, video) so it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language.
*   **Time-based Media (1.2):** Provide alternatives for time-based media (e.g., captions for audio, audio descriptions for video).
*   **Adaptable (1.3):** Create content that can be presented in different ways (e.g., simpler layout) without losing information or structure. This includes proper semantic markup (headings, lists, tables).
*   **Distinguishable (1.4):** Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.
    *   **Color Contrast (1.4.3):** Ensure a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for regular text and 3:1 for large text.
    *   **Resizable Text (1.4.4):** Allow text to be resized without loss of content or functionality up to 200%.
    *   **No Loss of Content on Zoom (1.4.10):** Content remains functional and usable when zoomed up to 400% without requiring horizontal scrolling.

#### Operable:
*   **Keyboard Accessible (2.1.1):** Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
*   **Enough Time (2.2):** Provide users enough time to read and use content (e.g., adjustable timeouts).
*   **Seizures and Physical Reactions (2.3):** Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions (e.g., no more than three flashes in any one-second period).
*   **Navigable (2.4):** Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
    *   **Focus Order (2.4.3):** Ensure logical and intuitive tab order for keyboard navigation.
    *   **Link Purpose (2.4.4):** Make link purpose clear from the link text alone or its context.
    *   **Multiple Ways (2.4.5):** Provide multiple ways to find web pages (e.g., sitemap, search, consistent navigation).
*   **Input Modalities (2.5):** Make it easier for users to operate functionality with various inputs beyond keyboard.
    *   **Target Size (2.5.5):** Ensure target size for interactive elements is at least 44x44 CSS pixels (critical for AAC touch users).

#### Understandable:
*   **Readable (3.1):** Make text content readable and understandable.
    *   **Language of Page (3.1.1):** Programmatically determine the human language of each Web page.
*   **Predictable (3.2):** Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
    *   **Consistent Navigation (3.2.3):** Ensure consistent navigation mechanisms across the site.
    *   **Consistent Identification (3.2.4):** Components with the same functionality are identified consistently.
*   **Input Assistance (3.3):** Help users avoid and correct mistakes.
    *   **Error Identification (3.3.1):** Clearly identify input errors.
    *   **Labels or Instructions (3.3.2):** Provide labels or instructions for input fields.

#### Robust:
*   **Compatible (4.1):** Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
    *   **Parsing (4.1.1):** Ensure markup is well-formed and valid.
    *   **Name, Role, Value (4.1.2):** Ensure all user interface components (including form elements, links, and components generated by scripts) have a programmatically determinable name, role, and value.

### Success Metrics:
*   Successful completion of an external WCAG 2.1 AA audit.
*   All new and migrated features pass internal accessibility checks (e.g., automated tools, manual keyboard testing, screen reader testing).
*   Positive feedback from user testing with individuals using various assistive technologies.
