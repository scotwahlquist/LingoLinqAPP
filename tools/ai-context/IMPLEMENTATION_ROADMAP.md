# LingoLinq-AAC Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a phased approach for the modernization and enhancement of the LingoLinq-AAC application, building upon the existing `MODERNIZATION_ROADMAP.md` and incorporating detailed deliverables and success metrics.

## Phase 1: MVP Stabilization & Foundation (Estimated: 3-6 Months)

**Goal:** Establish a secure, stable, and maintainable foundation for future development, ensuring core AAC functionality is robust.

### Deliverables:
*   **Security Audit & Fixes:** Complete comprehensive security scans (`bundle audit`, `npm audit`, Brakeman) and remediate all identified critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Updates (Backend):** Upgrade Rails from 6.1 to 7.2, and update all Ruby gems to their latest compatible versions. Address any breaking changes.
*   **Development Environment Standardization:** Document and automate setup for consistent developer environments (e.g., Docker Compose for local development).
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:** Implement automated testing (RSpec, frontend tests), linting, and deployment pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for faster, more reliable releases.
*   **Critical Bug Fixes:** Address all known production-blocking and high-priority bugs in the existing application.
*   **Core Communication Board Stability:** Ensure the primary communication board functionality is highly stable, performant, and error-free.
*   **Basic User Management Refinement:** Review and stabilize user registration, login, and profile management.

### Success Metrics:
*   0 critical/high-severity security vulnerabilities reported by automated scans.
*   All core dependencies updated to target versions.
*   CI/CD pipeline successfully running all tests and deploying to staging/production environments.
*   Reduction in reported production bugs by 80%.
*   99.9% uptime for core communication board features.

## Phase 2: Modernization & Core UX (Estimated: 6-12 Months)

**Goal:** Begin the transition to a modern frontend, establish a consistent design language, and improve core user experience.

### Deliverables:
*   **Frontend Framework Decision:** Finalize choice between React, Vue.js, or modern Rails with Stimulus based on accessibility, performance, and team expertise criteria.
*   **Design System & Component Library:** Develop and document a comprehensive design system (colors, typography, spacing, iconography) and build a reusable, accessible component library in the chosen frontend framework.
*   **Progressive Frontend Migration (Key Pages):** Migrate critical user flows and high-traffic pages (e.g., main communication board, user dashboard, settings) from Ember.js to the new frontend framework.
*   **Rails API Standardization:** Refactor existing Rails controllers to provide a clean, consistent API for the new frontend.
*   **Database Optimization (Initial Pass):** Identify and optimize N+1 queries, add necessary indexes, and review schema for performance improvements.
*   **Initial WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:** Conduct an initial accessibility audit on migrated pages and implement fixes to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

### Success Metrics:
*   Design system and component library fully documented and adopted.
*   At least 30% of critical user-facing pages migrated to the new frontend.
*   Improved page load times and rendering performance on migrated sections (e.g., 20% reduction in Largest Contentful Paint).
*   Initial WCAG 2.1 AA audit passes for migrated components/pages.

## Phase 3: AI/ML Feature Integration (Estimated: 9-15 Months)

**Goal:** Integrate intelligent AI/ML capabilities to enhance communication and user support.

### Deliverables:
*   **LLM Integration Architecture:** Implement a secure and scalable LLM API layer (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT) for text generation and understanding.
*   **Vocabulary Intelligence Module:** Develop a module for curating and suggesting vocabulary based on academic subjects and user context.
*   **Real-time Translation Prototype:** Implement a prototype for real-time text translation within the communication interface.
*   **Predictive Text Engine (Basic):** Develop a basic predictive text feature for communication boards, suggesting next words/phrases based on common usage patterns.
*   **Usage Analytics Dashboard:** Build an internal dashboard to visualize user communication patterns, popular words/phrases, and board usage for optimization.

### Success Metrics:
*   Successful integration of at least one LLM API.
*   Vocabulary intelligence module providing relevant suggestions with >80% accuracy.
*   Real-time translation prototype functional with acceptable latency.
*   Predictive text feature demonstrating a measurable increase in communication efficiency (e.g., 10% reduction in button presses for common phrases).
*   Analytics dashboard providing actionable insights for feature development.

## Phase 4: Advanced UX & Feature Enhancements (Estimated: 12-18 Months)

**Goal:** Refine the user experience, achieve full accessibility compliance, and introduce advanced features.

### Deliverables:
*   **Full WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:** Complete a comprehensive accessibility audit across the entire application and remediate all remaining issues.
*   **Mobile-Responsive Design:** Ensure a seamless and optimized experience across all mobile devices (phones, tablets) and orientations.
*   **User Experience Flow Optimization:** Conduct in-depth user research and usability testing with AAC users to identify and optimize complex workflows.
*   **Advanced Content Creation Tools:** Enhance tools for creating and customizing communication boards, including drag-and-drop interfaces, richer media support, and template libraries.
*   **Integration with External AAC Tools:** Explore and implement integrations with other popular AAC tools or platforms (if applicable and beneficial).

### Success Metrics:
*   100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified by external audit.
*   Positive user feedback on mobile experience (e.g., 90% satisfaction rate).
*   Measurable improvements in task completion times for key workflows (e.g., 15% faster board creation).
*   Increased adoption of advanced content creation features.
*   Successful integration with at least one external AAC tool.
