# Senior Dev Strategic Roadmap - LingoLinq AAC

**Created**: 2025-01-31  
**Senior Developer**: Post-Merge Cleanup & Strategic Planning  
**Status**: Phase 1 - Infrastructure & Tooling

## ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Actions (This Week)**

### High Priority (Complete First)
- [ ] **Merge cleanup branch to main** - Get critical fixes into production
- [ ] **Set up automated testing pipeline** - Prevent future branding/API issues
- [ ] **Create Ruby version validation script** - Help developers avoid version conflicts
- [ ] **Document API headers** - Prevent future inconsistencies

### Medium Priority (Next Steps)
- [ ] **Audit remaining CoughDrop references** - Complete branding cleanup
- [ ] **Set up error monitoring** - Track issues in production
- [ ] **Create development health check** - Validate environment setup
- [ ] **API documentation start** - Begin documenting the "completely-undocumented" API

## ðŸš€ **Strategic Development Phases**

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure & Tooling (Weeks 1-2)**

#### âœ… Completed
- [x] Post-merge cleanup and branding consistency fixes
- [x] Setup Claude and Gemini CLI tooling for team productivity
- [x] Comprehensive documentation of issues and fixes
- [x] API header consistency across frontend/backend

#### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement**
  - Add automated testing for Rails (RSpec) and Ember (QUnit)
  - Implement linting checks to prevent branding inconsistencies
  - Set up deployment pipeline with proper staging
  - Add API header validation tests in CI

- [ ] **Development Environment Standardization**
  - Create Docker setup for consistent dev environments
  - Document Ruby version management (rbenv/rvm)
  - Standardize Node.js requirements (update from current setup)
  - Create health check script for new developers

- [ ] **Code Quality & Monitoring**
  - Implement error tracking (currently using Bugsnag - optimize)
  - Set up performance monitoring for both Rails and Ember
  - Add RuboCop and ESLint with consistent rules
  - **Priority**: Start API documentation (currently undocumented!)

### **Phase 2: Technical Debt & Modernization (Months 1-3)**

#### Frontend Modernization
- [ ] **Ember.js Upgrade Evaluation**
  - Current version analysis and upgrade path planning
  - Remove bower dependencies (deprecated package manager)
  - Implement modern JavaScript bundling and module system
  - Update to latest ESLint configurations and testing frameworks

#### Backend Optimization  
- [ ] **Rails Upgrade Planning**
  - Evaluate Rails 7.x upgrade from current 6.1
  - Plan Ruby 3.3.x compatibility (when Rails supports it)
  - Database performance analysis and optimization
  - Background job (Resque) monitoring and optimization

#### Security Hardening
- [ ] **Security Audit**
  - Review API endpoints for security vulnerabilities
  - Update dependencies with known security issues
  - Enhance rate limiting (currently using rack-attack)
  - Review authentication mechanisms and session management

### **Phase 3: Feature Development & Architecture (Months 3-6)**

#### API & Developer Experience
- [ ] **API Documentation Project** ðŸš¨ **HIGH PRIORITY**
  - Document the currently "completely-undocumented API"
  - Implement API versioning strategy
  - Create client libraries for mobile app developers
  - Set up developer portal and documentation site

#### Multi-Platform App Modernization
- [ ] **Mobile App Strategy**
  - Evaluate Cordova replacement options (Capacitor, React Native, etc.)
  - Improve Electron app security and auto-update mechanisms
  - Implement cross-platform automated testing
  - Enhance Progressive Web App capabilities

#### Performance & Scalability
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Database query optimization and monitoring
  - Caching strategy improvements (Redis optimization)
  - CDN implementation for static assets
  - Load testing and capacity planning for growth

### **Phase 4: Innovation & Growth (Months 6+)**

#### AI/ML Integration
- [ ] **Modern AAC Features**
  - Implement advanced communication prediction algorithms
  - Enhance voice recognition and synthesis capabilities
  - Improve accessibility features for users with complex needs
  - Real-time communication and collaboration features

#### Platform Expansion
- [ ] **Technology Modernization**
  - Modern web standards implementation (WebRTC, PWA, etc.)
  - Offline-first architecture improvements
  - Integration with other assistive technology platforms
  - Enhanced real-time features for supervisors and teams

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Technical Debt Items**

### Immediate Risk Items
1. **API Documentation** - "completely-undocumented API" creates maintenance risk
2. **Ember.js Version** - Outdated version may have security vulnerabilities
3. **Bower Dependencies** - Deprecated package manager needs replacement
4. **Ruby Version Constraints** - Need clear upgrade path planning

### Technical Architecture Improvements Needed
1. **Testing Coverage** - Ensure comprehensive test coverage for API changes
2. **Error Handling** - Standardize error responses across API endpoints
3. **Performance Monitoring** - Better visibility into application performance
4. **Security Review** - Regular security audits for AAC user data protection

## ðŸ“Š **Success Metrics & KPIs**

### Development Team Productivity
- Reduced time for new developer onboarding
- Faster feature development cycles
- Fewer production bugs and rollbacks
- Improved code review processes

### Application Quality
- API documentation coverage (currently 0% - target 90%+)
- Test coverage improvements
- Performance benchmarks (page load times, API response times)
- Security audit compliance scores

### User Experience
- Reduced authentication issues (header consistency fixes)
- Improved offline functionality
- Better cross-platform compatibility
- Enhanced accessibility features for AAC users

## ðŸ’¡ **Innovation Opportunities**

### Short-term Wins
- Modern development tooling improving team velocity
- Better error tracking reducing support burden
- API documentation enabling external integrations

### Long-term Vision
- Platform expansion to new assistive technology integrations
- AI-powered communication assistance features
- Enhanced real-time collaboration for AAC support teams
- Modern PWA capabilities for better offline experience
